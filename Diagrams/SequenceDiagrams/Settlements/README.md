# Settlement Process Sequence Diagrams

Settlement related sequence diagrams source files (.plantuml) have been moved to the [documentation](https://github.com/mojaloop/documentation/tree/master/mojaloop-technical-overview/central-settlements/assets/diagrams/sequence) repository. The usage of this folder for storing sequence diagrams SVG files is deprecated, hence it is to be deleted soon! Settlement related documentation is available [here](http://mojaloop.io/documentation/mojaloop-technical-overview/central-settlements).
